A Library Management System is a project that tries to create an automated and computerised version for a library so that the daily work of a library can be managed and monitored easily and efficiently. Earlier, the librarian used to manage the whole work in manual mode in the form of files and record books.

The purpose of this project is to provide a friendly environment to maintain the details of books and library members.

The main aim of this project is to provide an easy to handle and automated library management system. This project also provides features and an interface for maintaining librarian's records, student's history of issues, and fines
